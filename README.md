# BodyFat
Machine learning project to predict body fat given measuremnets of individuals. 
Data set taken from kaggel https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/body-fat-prediction-dataset

Three regression models were implemented in order to predict the body fat measurements: linear regression, random forest, and xgboost.
The three models all acheeived R2 scores of .99, of the three Random Forest performed the best based on MAE and RMSE.
